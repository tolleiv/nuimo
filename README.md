# Golang library to interact with Nuimo devices

This library uses the [currentlabs/ble](https://github.com/currentlabs/ble) library and implements an interaction layer for [Senic Nuimo devices](https://www.senic.com/). See also [nathankunicki/nuimojs](https://github.com/nathankunicki/nuimojs) for NodeJS library to interact with Nuimo, it was a good inspiration for the library.
 
## Disclaimer
 
At the moment this is a weekend project for me to learn Golang programming. Feel free to suggest changes which change to code and interaction to be more #Golang style.
 
 
## Usage
